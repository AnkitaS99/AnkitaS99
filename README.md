# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hey there! I'm Ankita
Welcome to my corner of GitHub — where you'll find both my code and my thoughts ☕💻

🧠 About Me
🛠️ Student by morning, developer by evening, story devourer by night

💡 Passionate about clean code, smart solutions, and continuous learning (the grind never stops am I right? 😪)

🎯 My productivity peaks under deadlines.

👈 Proudly left-handed (which means I write code with the right side of the brain 😄)

📖 I can finish a fiction book in one sitting — challenge accepted!

🇩🇪📚I spreche auch ein bisschen Deutsch *(that means "I also speak a little bit of German")*
