Welcome to my corner of GitHub — where you'll find both my code and my thoughts ☕💻

🧠 About Me
🛠️ Student by morning, developer by evening, story devourer by night

📚 I can finish a fiction book in one sitting — challenge accepted!

💡 Passionate about clean code, smart solutions, and continuous learning (the grind never stops am I right? 😪)

🎯 My productivity peaks under deadlines.

🔍 What You’ll Find Here
